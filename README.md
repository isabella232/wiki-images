# wiki-images
Repository to hold images for wiki documents. To use this repository, please create a directory for a project under the pravega org, assuming one doesn't yet exist, and create a folder under the project for the corresponding document. For example, if you want to add images to a PDP in the pravega wiki, e.g., PDP-11,  create a folder `pravega/pdp-11` and add images to that folder.
